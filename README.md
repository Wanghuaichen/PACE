PACE
====
This project contains Arduino code for Turbidostats as well as
the server software to provide an on-screen interface to Turbidostat
control and Web interface.

SWI-Prolog based web server, GUI, and Turbidostat control software
written mostly in Prolog with some Python and HTML.

Running PACE on a Linux or Windows machine provides an interface
for up to 16 turbidostats: USB connected Arduinos running 'apace'.
It also contains a web server for essentially the same interface
via the URL:  <machine-name>:8080/pace.pl
